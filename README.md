# odin-recipes
Website about Odin Project recipes created using only HTML 

This project was done to demonstrate all that I learned on the basics of HTML and CSS  based on the
Odin Project foundations course(Block and Inline) page. This project will also help me practice the use of the
command line interface for git and unix shell commands.
